        <h2>Personal Projects</h2>
        <h3>Analysis of Gender, Education Level, and Salary Differences by Country</h3>
        <p>This study aimed to analyze gender, education level, and salary differences across various countries using fictional data for exploratory analysis. The data, though not real, provides insights into potential disparities.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Gender Distribution by Country:
                <p>Visualizing gender distribution in each country, this chart helps identify gender imbalances or equality, offering insights into potential gender disparities.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Education Level Distribution by Country:
                <p>Examining the distribution of education levels (primary, secondary, tertiary) in each country, this chart offers insights into educational systems and qualification levels.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Salary Level by Country:
                <p>Comparing salary distributions between countries, this chart uses box plots to highlight salary inequalities and variations, showcasing potential salary gaps.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Percentage Increase Year Over Year by Country:
                <p>Tracking salary changes year over year in each country, this chart reveals trends and identifies countries with significant salary growth or stagnation.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Concluding the project, this analysis provides an overview of potential disparities between the studied countries. While the data is fictional, it underscores the importance of monitoring gender, education, and salary disparities to promote equality and fairness.</p>

        <h3>Study of Economic Indicators in Africa (Confidential Data)</h3>
        <p>Conducted an in-depth analysis of confidential economic indicators in African countries using R. The project involved handling sensitive data to gain insights into the economic landscape of the region. Detailed findings and conclusions are available upon request due to the confidential nature of the data.</p>

        <h2>Personal Projects</h2>
        <h3>Mini Python Project - Graph Theory</h3>
        <p>This study demonstrates how graph theory can be used to analyze hypothetical brain connection networks. The fictional brain network graph created for this demonstration is a highly simplified example and does not represent real brain data. In a real context, the analysis of brain networks would require appropriate brain imaging data and advanced analysis methods in neuroscience.</p>

        <h2>Personal Projects</h2>
        <h3>Simulation Study of Epidemic Spread in a 2D Environment</h3>
        <p>The objective of this study was to simulate the spread of an epidemic in a 2D environment. We employed an SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) model-based approach to model the states of each individual and their interactions.</p>
        <h4>Methodology</h4>
        <p>We used the R programming language to develop the simulation code. The code was organized into several functions describing individuals' behaviors, movement, state updates, and interactions. We also utilized libraries such as "ggplot2" and "gridExtra" for generating charts and visualizing results.</p>
        <p>The simulation ran in iterations over several days. At each iteration, we updated individuals' states based on their current state, neighborhood, and specified rules. Individuals could be susceptible, infectious, recovered, or deceased, and their state evolved based on probabilities of transmission, recovery, death, and return to susceptibility.</p>
        <p>Average distances between individuals and certain centers were taken into account to influence interactions. Completed last year as part of assisting a first-year student.</p>
